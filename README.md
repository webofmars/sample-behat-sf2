behat-proof
===========

A working tutorial for setup behat with Symfony2 projects

* install google chrome
* install xvfb (if you want to run no gui tests)
* install chrome webdriver - (see https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/)

# Notes

* Support of selenium2 and Firefox seems to be quite broken, the last version of Firefox compatible with recent builds of selenium serveseems to be 32 (versions are 50 at the time of writting this)
  So not really worthing a try unless you except very big differences.
